## Support
You can report any issue or ask me questions here: [issues](https://github.com/modlfo/VultModules/issues)

## Use

The modules come in two versions: Free edition and Premium edition. Both versions contain over 15 high quality modules. I kept some of the modules free because I believe that everybody should have access to this creations that make me happy.

[Comparison Free vs. Premium](https://modlfo.github.io/VultModules/download/)

The paid modules (there are more coming) are the ones that do require more engineering and research work to develop. If you like the work I make for free, you should consider buying the paid modules to help me keep developing stuff.

The modules can be purchased from the VCV Rack store. If you donâ€™t want the paid modules, but still want to donate you can do so as well. Finally, if you just want the free modules you can download them in the github page.

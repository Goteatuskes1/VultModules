Vessek started modeling the basic circuit of an analog saw wave oscillator. Most of the parameters were initially obtained from my compact analog bass synth. I got a pretty good matching of the sound that I bet it would pass a blind test. Later in the development, samples of other well known analog oscillators were sent to me by members of the VCV Rack community. From the samples I was able of extracting characteristics of the waves that help me fit my greybox model.

After some more mathematical processing I turned the model into something more efficient that still produces a very good analog sound.

The current model is a blend of the characteristics of different analog oscillators with some added tweaks to give Vessek it's own personality.

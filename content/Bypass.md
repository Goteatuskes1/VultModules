Bypass (or Util-Bypass) provides an easy way to engage or disengage an audio effect. Bypass can be used to convert any effect into a stompbox like effect allowing to turn it on or off with the press of a pedal.

## Documentation

- **Status**: displays if the effect is engaged (light on) or disengaged (light off). This is so far the only light that you'll find in any Vult module.
- **Mode**: defines how the Bypass behaves when the gate signal fires or the manual button are pressed.
   - **Toggle**: when there's a gate or the button is pressed, Bypass will change from on to off or viceversa.
   - **Push**: the effect will be on while the gate is high or the button is pressed.
- **Send (jacks)**: provides the audio signal to connect to you audio processor.
- **Return (jacks)**: inputs of the processed signal.
- **Output (jacks)**: the mixed audio signal.
- **Input (jacks)**: inputs the unprocessed audio signal.

Slap is an envelope based on the electrical circuit I found in a book of electronics for music. Slap has the same hitting nature of Spank. The module includes a VCA so you can use it directly to control an input source.

## Documentation

Each of the following controls provides an attenuverter and a CV input to modulate them.

- **Attack (Knob)**: rising rate of the envelope.
- **Decay (Knob)**: decaying rate until the signal reaches the Sustain value .
- **Sustain (Knob)**: value at which the envelope signal stays until the gate input is less than 2V.
- **Release (Knob)**: rate at which the envelope returns to 0V.
- **Mode (Switch)**:
   - **Soft**: provides longer transitions times and less snappy envelope.
   - **Hard**: faster transition times and more snappy envelope.
- **VCA(Section)**: it's an integrated VCA where the input is multiplied by the envelope.
- **Gate(Input)**: a signal larger than 2 V will trigger the envelope. 
- **Out(Output)**: actual output of the envelope signal.

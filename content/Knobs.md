Knobs (or Util-Knobs) is a simple but very handy utility. Knobs features four inputs with attenuverters and a big offset knob. Knobs can be used for many purposes, for example: to blend many modulation signals and send them to a single destination, as audio mixer, as constant voltage output.

## Documentation

Knobs contains two similar sections. Most of the elements in the interface are unlabeled.

- **Mode**: defines how the big knob behaves.
   - **Uni**: produces an unipolar signal ranging from 0V to 10V.
   - **Bip**: produces an bipolar signal ranging from -5V to 5V.
   - **Mix**: the big knob acts as a master level control and all signals are added.
- **(Big Knob)**: depending on the mode, it defines the offset voltage in the output.
- **(Small knobs)**: these are attenuverters that control the amplitude of the input signal below.
- **(Output Jack)**: outputs the combined signal: all inputs with it's corresponding attenuation plus the main offset defined by the Big Knob.

To use as a mixer, set the mode to Bi (Bipolar) and control the volumes with the attenuverters.

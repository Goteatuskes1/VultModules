Flame is a simulation of three different distortion pedals and three tone circuits. 

Over the years, I have build many distortion pedals based on known designs. Often times I didn't have the exact components that the pedal required and I just used what I had. I built three different distortion circuits that I intended to use in my real eurorack and I based Flame on those three modules.

## Documentation

Each of the following controls provides an attenuverter and a CV input to modulate them.

- **Fuel**: this is the main knob of Flame that controls the level of distortion. In low levels adds a little bit of bite, in it's maximum you get the full destruction.
- **Tone**: controls the balance between the frequencies. It behaves differently depending on the Tone model.
- **Blend**: it's a dry/wet control to balance how much of the original and processed signal you want.
- **Type**:
   - **Rodent**: provides a hard-clipping style of distortion.
   - **Cylinder**: a more subtle distortion in a soft-clipping style.
   - **Blur**: a very aggressive and asymmetrical distortion.
- **Tone**:
   - **Crem**: full left reduces the treble and add a bit of boost to the bass. Full right opens in full trebble and boost the mid range.
   - **Diez**: full left boost the bass and cuts the treble. Full right cuts the bass and boost the treble. Adds a notch around 500 Hz.
   - **Puff**: Similar in behavior to Diez, but the notch is around 1Khz.
- **Input**: left and right inputs to the distortion. If only one is connected, the processed signal is send to both outputs.
- **Output**: left and right outputs.

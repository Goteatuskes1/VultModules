Basal is a easy to use and nice sounding oscillator. It's specifically designed for creating smooth sounds with low harmonic content. Basal features a self modulation technique that acts when the oscillator is moved.

## Documentation

- **Tune**: offsets the V/OCT input one octave up or down.
- **Oct**: offsets the V/OCT input three octaves up and down.
- **Mod 1**: creates overtones by distorting the phase of the main oscillator (-10V to +10V). The CV input is attenuverted according to the smaller encoder and then added to Mod 1.
- **Mod 2**: increases the number of harmonics (-10V to +10V). The CV input is attenuverted according to the smaller encoder and then added to Mod 2.
- **V/OCT**: this is the main input of the oscillator. It defines the pitch using the 1V per octave convention. Zero volts corresponds to a C3 note.
- **Out**: main output of the oscillator.

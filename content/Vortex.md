Vortex is filter based on a famous russian design. The filter is a Low pass and Band pass capable of self-oscillating. Vortex is a detailed simulation of the original circuit with a few small tweaks to give my personal touch.

Vortex is part of the Premium package that can be purchased through the VCV store.

## Documentation

- **Cutoff**: this is the main knob in a filter. It defines the frequency at which the filter starts taking action. Full left, the filter is completely closed. Full right it's open and should not have effect. The cutoff frequency can be controlled with a 1V/Oct signal through the included attenuverter.
- **Resonance**: the resonance boost the frequencies near the cutoff frequency. Increase this knob and you will hear the personality of the filter. After some point the filter will start self-oscillating and can be used as a sound generator.
- **Drive**: controls the amount of signal that enters to the filter. Increasing the drive will cause the filter to saturate which adds interesting harmonics to the sound.
- **Outputs**:
   - **LP**: Low pass output. Good for making anything sound awesome.
   - **BP**: Band pass output. When static, this band is not very interesting, but when modulated magic happens.
- **Input**: You may provide an input signal to be filtered, but only if you want to. If not, just crack up the resonance and the filter will self-oscillate.

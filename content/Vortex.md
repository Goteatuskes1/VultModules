Vortex is filter based on a famous russian design. The filter is a 6 dB Low pass and Band pass capable of self-oscillating. Vortex is a detailed simulation of the original circuit with a few small tweaks to give my personal touch.

Vortex is part of the Premium package that can be purchased through the VCV store.

Nurage was modeled after a modded version of the most famous Low Pass Gate. Nurage comprises Vult's own (very detailed) model of the vactrol control and the filter.

This module can be used to produce very natural sounding percussion sounds. It provides the possibility to enable or disable the Vactrol, the VCA and the possibility of using the module as stereo filter.


## Documentation

The Cutoff, Resonance and Drive knobs affect both filters. Each of these knobs provides an attenuverter and input jack for modulation.

### Main Controls

- **Cutoff**: this is the main knob in a filter. It defines the frequency at which the filter starts taking action. Full left, the filter is completely closed. Full right it's open and should not have effect. The cutoff frequency can be controlled with a 1V/Oct signal through the included attenuverter.
- **Resonance**: the resonance boost the frequencies near the cutoff frequency. Increase this knob and you will hear the personality of the filter. After some point the filter will start self-oscillating and can be used as a sound generator.
- **Drive**: controls the amount of signal that enters to the filter. Increasing the drive will cause the filter to saturate which adds interesting harmonics to the sound.

### Modulation and Gates

- **Gate (Jacks)**: these inputs, in addition to the dedicated CV input, control the cutoff frequency of the filters. The main difference with the CV input is that the attenuverter of the gates has amplification. This makes possible to increase the range of gate signals with low level. Depending on the Gates mode switch, the Gate signals can control both or each filter separately.

- **Vactrol (Switch)**: enables and disables the Vactrol control of the gate. With the Vactrol ON, the filter presents smoother transitions due to the Vactrol memory effect. With the Vactrol OFF, the controls signals immediately affect the Cutoff.

- **VCA (Switch)**: Enables of disables the VCA mode. In VCA mode, the filter not only changes the cutoff frequency but also affects the amplitude of the signal. One thing to notice is that by enabling the VCA mode the resonance of the filter is extremely reduced.

- **Gates (Switch)**: defined the behavior of the gates. In Link mode, both gates control both filters. In Unlink mode, the left Gate control the Left filter and the right the Right filter.

### Audio Inputs and Outputs

Nurage is a dual or stereo filter. It provides pairs of left and right inputs and outputs in order to simplify processing stereo signals.

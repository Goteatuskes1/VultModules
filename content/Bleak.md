Bleak is a virtual analog oscillator with zero aliassing that provides very easy to use controls to help you transform the waves. Bleak provides three waveforms that can be morphed and PW modulated.

## Documentation

- **Tune**: offsets the V/OCT input one octave up or down.
- **Oct**: offsets the V/OCT input three octaves up and down.
- **PW**: defines the pulse-with of the waves. In the case of saw and triangle an equivalent effect of the wave is provided.
- **Wave**: morphs continuously the waves.
   - Saw: full left
   - Pulse: center
   - Triangle: full right
- **V/OCT**: this is the main input of the oscillator. It defines the pitch using the 1V per octave convention. Zero volts corresponds to a C3 note.
- **Out**: main output of the oscillator.

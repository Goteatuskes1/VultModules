Julste is the only model that I haven't developed by myself. When I started doing research on low pass gates I came across the paper "A DIGITAL MODEL OF THE BUCHLA LOWPASS-GATE" by Julian Parker and Stefano Dâ€™Angelo. They did all the hard job modeling it, and I rewrote the code in the Vult language and created the module.

The module has a few extensions to the original model, like controls to process the gate input.

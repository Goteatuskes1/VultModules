Vult Compacts is a new series that will contain free and paid modules. The idea behind the Compacts is to create alternate versions of the existing modules and expand/redesign the functionality. For example: the new Freak filter contains all Vult filters in a single package.

These are some of the modules that are planed for the paid version of Vult Compacts:

- Trummor Kit: new percussion synthesizers derived from Trummor 2.
- Full Synth Voice: a Vult synthesizer in a single package.

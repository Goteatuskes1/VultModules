Tangents is a filter based on the Steiner-Parker structure. One big addition I made in this version compared with the hardware version is that this module leaves exposed three inputs (LP, BP and HP). This makes possible to connect three sources and affecting the frequency content for each input differently.

The paid version of Tangents has 3 different implementations. Each implementation is based on a different simulation model I developed. The original Tangents was based on the Steiner-Parker design by Yves Usson version (YuSynth). The other two models are based on some other well know filters that have a similar architecture.

Stabile is a state variable filter. It provides LP, HP, and BP filters. Additionally to the three filter outputs it provides an extra output imitates the behavior of the SEM filter.

The story of this filter goes even before the existence of Vult. I implemented the initial version of this filter in a microcontroller. With the years I have made many tweaks an simplifications. In fact this filter is very efficient and the sound is very effective.

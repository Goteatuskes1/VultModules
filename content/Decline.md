Decline is a simple and efficient equalizer. It consist of two peak filters, one high shelf and one low shelf.

## Documentation

All equalizers have a at least two controls: one for the Frequency and one for the Gain. The peak equalizers include an extra Q control. The actual values of the frequencies and gains can bee seed by enabling the tooltip values.

- **Freq**: defines the operating frequency of the equalizer.
- **dB**: defines the gain or attenuation in decibels.
- **Q**: defines the width of the affected band.

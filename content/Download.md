The modules come in two versions: Free edition and Premium edition. Both versions contain over 15 high quality modules. I kept some of the modules free because I believe that everybody should have access to this creations that make me happy.

The paid modules are the ones that do require more engineering and research work to develop. If you like the work I make for free, you should consider buying the paid modules to help me keep developing stuff.

The modules can be purchased from the VCV Rack store. If you don't want the paid modules, but still want to donate you can do so as well. Finally, if you just want the free modules you can download them in the github page.

## Free vs Premium

The Premium package is a superset of the Free package. All Free modules exists in the Premium package and can be used simultaneously if needed.

The Premium package contains the following extra modules:

- Vortex : russian Filter
- Flame : analog distortion.
- Noxious : pure distortion oscillator
- T.B.D: CMOS Filter
- T.B.D: multi compressor

## Future Development

I'm working on designing a new set of modules called: Vult Compacts. The main idea behind compacts is creating a set of modules with a most specific functionality. Some of the modules that have been defined are:

- Super filter: including most Vult filters (stereo).
- Full synthesizer voice: a VCO + VCF + LFO + Envelopes.
- Trummor kit: kick, snare, hats, toms and others.

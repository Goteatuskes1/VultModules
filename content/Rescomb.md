Rescomb is a resonant Comb filter. A comb filter is a special kind of filter that creates multiple spaced notches. This module provides an CV input which is tuned (1V/octave) and a feedback parameter. when the feedback is high it will resonate enhancing the frequencies of the comb.

This is the first module that I designed for VCV Rack. I really like Comb filters, so I coded in Vult a very simple version after playing with it and tweaking parameters I got this version. Rescomb is a weird effect, which in fact I use it more as an instrument than as a filter.

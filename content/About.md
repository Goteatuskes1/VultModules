The Vult modules are designed and coded by me [Leonardo Laguna Ruiz](http://modlfo.github.io). Most of the modules have been refined with ideas from very talented people of the VCV Rack community, like Alejandro Galán Álvaro. I create all these modules during my free time, driven by the passion I have for music, synthesizers, electronics and technology. These modules may not be created by a recognized software company, but they are created by a professional in area of modeling and simulation.

If you want to know more, you can find an interview with me here:[Switched On Rack: Meet the Devs](http://www.switchedonrack.com/meet-the-devs-vult.html)

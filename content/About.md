The Vult modules are designed by me [Leonardo Laguna Ruiz](http://modlfo.github.io) in collaboration with other members of the VCV community. I create all these modules during my free time, driven by the passion I have for music, synthesizers, electronics and  technology. These modules are not created by a professional music software company, but they are created by a professional in the modeling and simulation.

If you want to know more, you can find an interview with me here:[Switched On Rack: Meet the Devs](http://www.switchedonrack.com/meet-the-devs-vult.html)

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/modlfo) or hanging around the [VCV Rack Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/vcvrack/). You can also contact me at [modlfo@gmail.com](mailto:modlfo@gmail.com)


## Why are these modules free?

I come from MÃ©xico, and when I started making music in highschool most of the tools were prohibitively expensive. A few hundred dollars for a mexican student is still a lot of money. All the software I used back then was what I could get from a Computer Music magazine.

I have always been reluctant to use pirated software because I believe in the fair use of all the things. Nowadays my situation has changed and I can allow myself to pay for all the software I use. Commercial software (like the one I make professionally) could not exists without hundreds of people being paid to work on it full time.

I'm a supporter of Open Source that's why I donate money to the projects I use, and I also publish all the projects I make.

To answer the question "Why are these modules free?", they are free because I hope that they reach people that are in the same situation I was: without budget, but with a lot of musical ideas waiting to be realized. They are also free because I hope that the people who used them, and values all effort put, will feel happy enough and make a donation.

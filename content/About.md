[Vult](https://www.vult-dsp.com) is the side project of Dr. [Leonardo Laguna Ruiz](http://modlfo.github.io).

After more than 10 years developing scientific software, he decided to apply all his knowledge in electronics, mathematical modelling and simulation to his favorite hobby: Music Technology.
​

Currently, Leonardo still works developing the simulation core of Wolfram SystemModeler and runs Vult with the help of his family and friends.

​
Over the years, many people have helped with testing, design and ideas. My gratitude goes to:

- Alejandro Galán Álvaro
- David Rodriguez
- Xavier Blemont
- Nigel TheArt OfSound
- Simon Bader
- Omri Cohen
- Andrew Belt
- John Klimt
